## Fun with Filters and Frequencies

### Fun with filters

Filter is one of the most fundamental operation in image processing. We can use filters to extract different information. One of the most common filter is the gradient filter, defined as

$$\mathbf{D}_x = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \hspace{20mm} \mathbf{D}_y= \begin{bmatrix}
-1\\
1
\end{bmatrix}$$

Note that the gradient filter is essentially a first order approximation of the partial derivaties. Applying the derivative to the cameraman image, we see that the filter captures edge information in the $x$ and $y$ direction since intuitively, the derivative signal is large when neighboring pixels differ in intensity by much.

We can also compute the magnitude and direction of gradient, given by 
$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{cases}
  ||\nabla I||_2 = \sqrt{\bigg(\frac{\partial I}{\partial x}\bigg)^2 + \bigg(\frac{\partial I}{\partial y}\bigg)^2}\\
  \theta = \tan^{-1}(\frac{\partial I}{\partial y}\bigg/\frac{\partial I}{\partial x})
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
$$
