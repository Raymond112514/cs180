## Image Warping and Mosaicing

### Image Warping

The goal of this project is take two images in different angles and create an image mosaic by aligning, warping, and compositing them. We first take images of our choices and uses online labeling tool to label eight correspondence points. We will be using these points to estimate a homography map for registration later. 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">   
   <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/proj4_images/source_target.png" alt="Image 1" style="width: 90%; height: auto;"> 
</div> 
<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Labeled source and target images.</p>
