## Face morphing

### Overview

The goal of this project is to morph two faces to form a new face. One naive way is to directly take the average of two faces, as shown in Figure 1. This method, however, does not work well in general since the two images are often aligned. To morph two images, we therefore need two steps: alignment and color dissolving. In this project we will go through the process.

### Morphing two faces

#### Defining correspondence

To align two images, we start by labeling keypoints for both images, this is done using the online labeling tool. Next, we compute Deluaney triangulation using the Deluaney library. We used the average keypoints to compute the traingulation to make the triangulation less dependent on each images.
